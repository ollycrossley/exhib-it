# Exhib-It

## Introduction

Exhib-It is a Next.js based web project that aims to combine popular museum/art exhibition apis, display them for public view and then allow you to make your own exhibits!

## Getting Started

### Installing Packages 

Please run `npm install` to install all available packages. 

This project uses several node packages for its styling sources and other functionality, and are essential to the package.


### Setting up `.env` files 

This website runs on a single `.env` file in the root directory and should contain the following line:
```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_HARVARD_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Please contact the [Harvard API Team](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkmEBqH76HLMMiCC-GPPnhcvHC9aJS86E32dOd0Z8MpY2rvQ/viewform) to get your
api key for the harvard functionality to work.

## Running the website

To run a local version of the website for development, you can run `npm run dev`. 

Lastly, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
